Econometrics Learning App
The Econometrics Learning App is an interactive educational tool designed to help users understand key econometric concepts—Bias, Efficiency, and Consistency—through real-time simulations and visualizations. Built with Python and Streamlit, this application offers an engaging way to explore how different estimators perform under various conditions.

Features
Interactive Simulations:
Experiment with various parameters such as sample size, noise level, and bias factor to see how estimators behave in practice.

Visual Demonstrations:
The app displays detailed charts and graphs including:

Distribution of estimators over multiple simulations.
Confidence interval comparisons.
Convergence of estimators with increasing sample size.
Bias-Variance decomposition for Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Educational Content:
Each section includes clear explanations on econometric concepts:

Bias: Understanding how estimators deviate from the true parameter.
Efficiency: Comparing the precision (variance) of different estimators.
Consistency: Observing how estimators improve as the sample size increases.
Comprehensive Overview: Integrates all concepts to show the interplay between bias, variance, and overall error.
